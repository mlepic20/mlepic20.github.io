I work in the fields of privacy, security, compliance, and requirements engineering. My current research focuses on advancing the state of the art in requirements engineering by developing methods and tools that ensure that privacy and security requirements are adequately addressed in various types of systems, whether support platforms for researchers in computing, or enterprise wide systems in the government.
