# About Me

I have always been fascinated by emerging technology. In recent years, advances in computing, cheaper storage and ubiquitous sensors have given rise to what we call "big data". Over the past 10 years, I have studied many facets of emerging technology. This topic, however, has captured my attention more completely than any other.

Perhaps the largest implication of big data is its impact on privacy. Ubiquitous computing and big data are redefining the meaning of this concept. In fact, emerging technology is redefining how we understand ourselves and everything around us. I believe we must take an active part in redefining this new world and not simply deal with the consequences and impacts in retrospect. 

A large body of research is attempting to determine how and who should be responsible for protecting the security and privacy of the people in the information age. The question is complex and there will not only be one solution, highlighting the importance of inviting people from a variety of backgrounds to participate in the conversation. Whether through legislation, self-regulation, requirements engineering, interface design or user awareness, we must all take part in redefining security and privacy in our new world.

I believe in the power of bringing information to the masses. Knowledge is power and emerging information technology should rightly empower the people. However, more information means more data, and data has become the new commodity. Because data is so valuable, we must be vigilant in ensuring that those collecting it can continue to innovate while maintaining the privacy and autonomy of the people. Big data and privacy protections may often seem at odds with one another, but this only makes the problem more fascinating, and I believe that by taking a multi-disciplinary approach we can effectively change this apparent dichotomy.
