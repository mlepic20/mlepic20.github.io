# **HANDLERY HOTEL**

All Security Scholars have confirmed private rooms at the Handlery Hotel, 351 Geary St. San Francisco, CA 94102.  Most students are arriving on Monday, February 13  and checking out on Friday, February 17th.  Attached are your confirmation numbers for the Handlery.  If you have arranged for more than 4 nights at the Handlery Hotel, you will need to pay for those additional nights onsite.   Handlery Hotel check-in is at 3 PM and check-out is at 12Noon.  You may call the hotel and request an early check-in (415-781-7800).  As our first meeting is at 3:30pm on Monday, you will need to check your bag with the front desk if your room isn’t ready upon arrival.   **Security Scholars will be required to present a credit card for incidentals at the time of check-in**.  All tips, laundry fees, parking, sundries, etc. are the responsibility of the Security Scholar. The Handlery Hotel has FREE Wi-Fi.

# **SHUTTLE SERVICE AND CLIPPER CARDS**

There is free daily shuttle service between conference hotels and Moscone Convention Center. The closest stop to the Handlery Hotel is across the street at the Westin St. Francis (red shuttle).  Please refer to the [shuttle schedule](https://www.rsaconference.com/events/us17/hotels-venue/hotels) on the conference website.  However, please be aware that the shuttle lines (especially on Tuesday morning before the keynote) can be very long.   If weather permits, we recommend walking on Tuesday morning.  Walking distance from Handlery Hotel to Moscone Center is about .6 miles. Finally, Janette has sent everyone a [Clipper Card](https://www.clippercard.com/ClipperWeb/index.do).  Please make sure you bring your Clipper Card to the conference as this will provide you free transportation from the airport to the hotel via BART or Caltrain. Clipper Cards are also valid for most all other public transportation in and around San Francisco.

# **CONFERENCE BADGE**

Your full conference badge can be picked up on RSAC registration in Moscone West or Moscone North.  Conference materials can only be picked up at Moscone West (conference bag, etc.) .  All Security Scholars are pre-registered so you just need to sign in at a kiosk and pick up your badge.  The  badge will include a pocket guide and maps like the one below.   Please note:  you will need your conference badge to access the entire conference (including our Monday night in Room 133) as well as off-site parties at Jillian’s, OneMarket and all the RSAC Bash on Thursday night [locations ](https://www.rsaconference.com/events/us17/agenda/rsac-bash).

# **MONDAY INNOVATION SANDBOX**

There are several activities happening at the RSA Conference on [Monday ](https://www.rsaconference.com/events/us17/agenda/sessions?showEnrolled=false&search.day=20170213)prior to our 3:30 PM meeting in room 132.  In addition to the RSAC Security Scholar program, I also manage the [Innovation Sandbox Contest](https://www.rsaconference.com/events/us17/agenda/innovation-sandbox-contest) where 10 Finalists will compete for the coveted “Most Innovative Startup” award in the Viewing Point.  This event is quite fun as the startups only have 3 minutes to pitch their company to 5 judges … so it is really fast paced and you can see some of the leading innovations in our space in a matter of 1.5 hours.  The contest starts at 1 PM, but people begin lining up at noon.  Please feel free to drop by if you are interested.  You can locate both the Viewing Point and room 132 in the Moscone Center map below.

# **WEDNESDAY – “EXPERIENCE RSA”**

RSAC Security Scholars are offered a private breakfast at the RSA Booth, one of the premier sponsors of the Security Scholar program. During this time, youcan  participate in the RSA Holographic Challenge, network with RSA executives and product experts, and  get a ‘behind the scenes’ look at an expo halls inner workings.  Please look out for an email with more details or [click here](https://rsac-scholars-booth-breakfast.eventfarm.com/) to RSVP today.

# **RESERVED KEYNOTE SEATING – TUESDAY MORNING**

Security Scholars will have special seating for the opening keynote on Tuesday located at Moscone West.  Janette will distribute a ***special VIP keynote ticket*** at the Welcome Reception/Team Building on Monday afternoon.  If you can’t make it Monday afternoon, Janette will also have tickets available at Jillians on Monday night.  You will need to present this VIP ticket to enter Moscone West on Monday morning.  Once inside Moscone West, please meet Janette on the second Level where we will gather as a group to enter the keynote together.  Please arrive no later than 7am.
